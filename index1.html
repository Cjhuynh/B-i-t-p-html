       <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
       <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
       <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="World Health Organization">PhD</abbr> <br> 
           next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
       <h2>Starting dates</h2>
       <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at
           the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
               <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
               <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
           <p>You can find more information about <ins style="color: blue;">important university dates</ins> on our website.</p> <hr>
           <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
           <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere <br> 
               in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd <br>
                like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of <br>
                 priority:</p>
                 <ol>
                   <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                   <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                   <li> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>  and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
               </ol>
               <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, <br>
                    required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p> <hr>
                    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
                    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my <br>
                        favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
                   </p>
                   <p>Polynesian chicken dance <br>
                       A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around in a circle <br>
                        like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful". <br>
                       </p>
                       <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle
                           Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved <br> 
                           huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid <br>
                            movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as <br> 
                            Twerking.
                           </p>
                           <p>Arctic robot dance
                               An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new <br>
                                dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and <br>
                                 Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>
